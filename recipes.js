            "In a small bowl, sift together the dry ingredients (except chocolate & nuts). Add to the wet mixture in two parts and fold until combined. (If you beat this too long, you may get some gluten formation which will change the cookie texture).",

            "Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased baking sheets. There should be enough fat in the cookie dough to prevent sticking, but using parchment paper or non-stick pans may help if you find this not to be the case.",
            "Bake in the preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown (cooking times may vary). Let stand for about 1 minute and remove from hot baking sheet to cool on a wire rack."
